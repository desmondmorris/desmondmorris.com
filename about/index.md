# Hi, I'm Desmond.

<small>Not to be confused with this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Morris" target="_blank">Desmond Morris</a>.</small>

I am web software engineer living and working in NYC.  I am a grateful fan & supporter of open source software and I maintain and contribute to projects in various communities.  You can find most of my work on <a href="http://github.com/desmondmorris" target="_blank">Github</a>.

In 2006, I caught startup fever and founded the now defunct <a href="http://dudewheresmybar.com" target="_blank">dudewheresmybar.com</a>.  Since then, I have had the opportunity to consult and work for a bunch of really great companies including, Sony Music, NBC iVillage, The World Economic Forum and Ohio State.  I have also consulted for a small handfull of smaller startups.  Currently, I serve as the Director of Engineering over at <a href="http://dosomething.org" target="_blank">DoSomething.org</a>.

I babble on <a href="http://twitter.com/desmondmorris" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and keep track of my roamings on <a href="https://foursquare.com/desmondmorris" target="_blank">Foursquare</a>.
